# Codezero Microkernel

## What is Codezero?

Codezero is an L4 microkernel that has been written from scratch. It targets
embedded systems and its purpose is to act as a secure embedded hypervisor. It
aims to become the most modern L4 implementation by evolving the L4 microkernel
API into the future. In a nutshell, Codezero provides all the basic mechanism
to abstract away the hardware, build OS services, isolate applications and
fine-grain security in a single package.


## Why the name Codezero?

The project philosophy is to create the simplest and leanest microkernel that
is generic and applicable to many different applications. Feature creep is what
we don't have in Codezero. Simple, elegant design is the project philosophy.


## Why use Codezero?

Codezero aims to be technically cutting-edge. It's design is open and improves
by evolution. It is also easy-to-use, well-documented and portable, mostly
maturing on the ARM architecture. These might be the appealing reasons from a
technical point-of-view. It is also backed by a responsive team, in case you
have more demanding requirements.
